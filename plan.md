## Possible Failure Cases:
 - Add node
    - if node exists with the same name it should fail. `✓`
    - if the node's name is [not a valid node identifier](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) it should fail immediately `✓`
 - Add edge
    - if either of the nodes do not exist it automatically creates the node. I think this is fine as it is much more convienent. `✓`
    - it should also allow for node failure cases above based on their names `✓`
 - Remove node
    - if the node does not exist it should fail.
 - Remove edge
    - if no such edge exists it should fail
 - Add subgraph
    - if there is already a subgraph with the same name within the same parent it should fail
 - Remove subgraph
    - if no such subgraph exists it should fail
