 - subgraphs
 - save & load (potentially with 6-strings)
 - condense code in displaying defaults using the new graphviz pkg model
    - ex. all the symmetric vs not symmetric methods can be made a single method which chooses automatically relatively easily.

## TODO?
 - write tests for the ":" synatx stuff
 - ask james about prefered behaviour for adding node with the same name as an existing node. Currently fails.
 - Test all example from the python graphviz docs.
 - GV_Attr(node, "");
 - Allow photos to be used as nodes & composition of graphviz output photos (later)
 - Sort edges before outputting (nondeterminim) ???
 - pip install gaplint (linting gap)!
 - make it so when duplicates are added to global graph attrs the old values are automatically replaced
