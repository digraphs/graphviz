 - save & load (potentially with 6-strings)
 - condense code in displaying defaults using the new graphviz pkg model
    - ex. all the symmetric vs not symmetric methods can be made a single method which chooses automatically relatively easily.
 - Allow photos to be used as nodes & composition of graphviz output photos (later)
 - Make an abstraction - find in subgraph tree - which does a traversal of the tree of subgraphs to find a graph satisfying a predicate.
 - Make custom resolution of edges for FDP (see fdp example from the python package)
 - implement the fdp example from the python package
 - make it so when duplicates are added to global graph attrs the old values are automatically replaced
 - Improve behaviour arround ':' synatx - mimic python package

## TODO (ONCE THIS IS EMPTY THEN DONE!)
 - Ask about `Pluralize` - think james said to remove for old verisons of gap
 - Update docs
 - Add more unit tests
 - Thoroughly test the ':' syntax more (might have broke when the quotes were changed)
